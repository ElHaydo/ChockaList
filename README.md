# ChockaList
A simple drag and drop todo list with timesheets, dashboard, and automated report.

Your experience using ChocaList may be improved by knowing how it is intended to be different to other productivity tools.
Chocalist discourages using calendars, time-allocation and prior planning. Hence, you cannot allocate timeslots for tasks or create calendars.

Chocalist is an opinionated way of managing tasks which embraces uncertainty, fast-planning, and adaptability.
"Progress happens faster for those who measure". Chocalist encourages a check, measure and adapt approach to productivity.

John Doe and his anxious grandmother: 

JohnDoe has taken time off to look after his grandmother. Every morning he has breakfast with his grandmother and she asks him to do tasks around the house.
There are lots of tasks to be done and she gets emotional about everything which hasn't been completed. She asks each morning what he doing and if he finished
all the things she asked him to do they day before. John has enough work to fill a month, but each morning she asks why things aren't happening and 
asks him what he did the day before.
John uses ChocaList and creates a new task each time she brings up something new. He makes sure that each day has enough tasks to keep busy but not overwhelmed.
John has allocated "fixing the vacuum cleaner" to Thursday. Grandmar asks on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday if he has fixed the vacuum cleaner. John replies
"no, I am doing that on Thursday" and shows his grandmother the list. When grandmar asks if John can do it sooner, John can show her the tasks that are filling
each day before Thursday. Grandmar says "Can you do it on Wednesday if we move cleaning the pool to Thursday? Can you do it in that time?" John says "yes, 
if you're happy with that" and drags the task from Thursday to Wednesday and moves cleaning the pool to Thursday.

Grandmar feels like she is being looked after and says John is a very hard working and caring grandson. 
John is worried grandmar will get upset if she doesn't understand what is happening. He is happy that ChocaList is helping him talk to his grandmother about
what is happening around her house, without taking up too much of his time.

There are a few tasks John doesn't get done each day. Instead of having to move them around, they automatically go back into the task pool waiting to be assigned on a new day.
In the morning, John can tell his grandmother about the tasks he didn't get around to, but also tell her the things he has finished.



Jane Doe and her difficult work culture:

Jane starts work at a new firm and has to keep a timesheet. The firm she is working at has been using timesheets for so long that they don't really feel
like timesheets anymore. Her performance in her role is being measured based on the timesheet information she provides. She finds herself getting into trouble
when she feels she fills out her timesheet honestly. Jane doesn't like to lie, but she is starting to understand that these timesheets aren't for 
tracking time, but are used for billing and project performance. Instead she needs to allocate time strategically and based on what resources were used.
Jane feels uncomfortable having a record for how she spends her hours which doesn't reflect the actual time she spends her hours. Jane also worries how
she is going to keep track of all the minor details of each day.
Jane doesn't get enough time during the day to complete her timesheet. Sometimes she does have the time, but is feeling burned out and lets the task slip
just to get a breather. At the end of the fortnight her timesheet is due to be submitted and she has left it to the last day. Jane struggles to finish the
timesheet on time and feels completely run down in the process.

Jane's work provides her with a laptop and do not let her use her own devices to protect client information.

Jane decides to get ChocaList to deal with this problem. She creates a task for each of her projects. She uses the timer feature for each task to track how much time
she has spent on each task. At the end of each week, she gets the automated report, which shows her what tasks she has worked on and how long she has spent on each 
task. Finally, she can search the audit log to check which days she was doing each task, and what time they were.
Thanks to ChocaList she can use the weekly reports to complete her timesheets more strategically. She keeps a personal timesheet in chocalist where she can 
know how she actually spends her time without the company telling her off for her honesty.



Kermit Spacy and his greenfield startup:

Kermit has decided to work for himself. He wants the dream of self-employment and no boss to breathe down his neak. Kermit is ready to work hard and gets off to
a great start. After 3 months of work and little traction, Kermit is starting to loose momentum. His calendar planning has started to become chaotic as he 
mixed personal and professional responsibilities. He still isn't ready for clients, but all of his tasks feels like they do not solve the problems he needs to 
solve in order to get clients.
Kermit finds if his tasks are big, there is no point having them on a calendar. He finds if they are too small, they are unmanagable. Kermit started planning his 
planning in his calendar and found he spends 4 hours every friday planning, plus 2 hours over the course of the week adjusting. Kermit is already loosing 1 day a 
week simply to paperwork and he is starting to question if he knows what he is doing. Kevin isn't used to doing it all alone. He isn't used to having no clients 
for this long, and he definetly isn't used to having nobody to ask for guidance. Kermit is starting to wonder if he is naive for loosing the boss and thinks
he isn't able to be productive if unsupervised. This makes Kermit depressed as this makes him feel like he is doomed to a miserable life working under difficult managers.
Because his personal life and professional life have no seperation, he is also forced to consider if he will ever have time for his personal life.
This is now making him question everything, if he can be a good partner, parent, friend, and his individuality at its core.

Kermit uses Chocalist and finds its simplicity reduces the noise of corporate solutions. He likes that he can mix big tasks and little tasks together.
He finds it easy to tag his tasks so he can tell the difference between personal and work items. He can now manage the personal and professional balance together on the 
same page/view and knows what feels right. His work into Business development is tracked as a single task. Time spent on learning his business obligations 
is tracked too. He does not have to allocate those big tasks a particular day to work on, he just keeps them in the task pool and clicks on their timers when he needs to.

Kermit also adds little tasks which need to get done. He can allocate these to days so he knows when to do them. He can begin to see some 
signal within what used to be noise. He can now be more creative with his business and how he gets work done.

Kermit gets automated reports at the end of each week and a timesheet to go with it. He can use this to track his productivity and catch any trends or changes in his
behaviour and environment. He doesn't feel like he is guessing as much as he did before. Kermit has a home office, he also uses ChocaList to determine how many hours 
each week it's used as an office, which helps him complete his tax returns at the end of the financial year.

Kermit was struggling before, because he was planning with no clear idea of what obstacles he would face. Each obstacle made it harder to see the path forward.
With ChocaList, Kermit became more tollerant to uncertainty, moving forward with more focus on tracking progress and less focus on planning progress.
